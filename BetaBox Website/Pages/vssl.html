Overview

VSSL is a sleek and compact vessel for survival gear. At about the same size and weight as a traditional heavy-duty flashlight, VSSL includes fifteen different tools that help you survive the elements.

The rugged aluminum tube screws onto a super-bright LED flashlight on one end and an oil-filled compass on the other. In between, VSSL holds 7 additional weather-resistant metal canisters that nestle together, each containing a valuable survival tool.

VSSL packs in so much useful stuff that if it weren’t so serious, we’d call it a clown car of survival tools.
