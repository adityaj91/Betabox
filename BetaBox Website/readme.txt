Download node js
Navigate to /BetaBox Website/pages/betabox  in your command prompt
Run npm start (if this doesn't work, check your environment variables for node)
I created this betabox folder using express. 
I did 

npm -g install express
npm express -e AppName
It should be set up now and activated with just a npm start or node server command.

If you have questions on creating more setups using express, check here for information:
